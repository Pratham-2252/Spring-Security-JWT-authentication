# Spring-Security-JWT-authentication
JWT authentication implemented by java spring boot.

This project is a Java Spring Boot application implementing JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. It secures endpoints by issuing a token to users upon successful login, which must then be included in the headers of subsequent requests for authorized access. JWT provides stateless, scalable security, making it ideal for modern web applications. Key features include user registration, login, and role-based authorization.
